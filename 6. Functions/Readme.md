# **Functions :**  

### **Why Functions? :**  

As we repeat statements, higher are the chances of accidentally introducing bugs, decreases the readability of the code.  


### **Creating Functions :**  

Using `def` keyword.

*Syntax:*  
```python
def function_name:
    Body
```
### **Calling Functions :**

*Syntax:*  
```python
def function_name:
    Body

function_name()  #calls the function
```

> Note:  
In order for python to identify a function, we must declare it before calling.
