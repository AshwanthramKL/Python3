# **Errors and Exceptions :**  

* Python raises an exception when something goes wrong while executing your code. It stops the program and creates an exception.

* If it is not taken care of, the programm will be terminated and an error message is displayed.  

* If it is handled well, the suspended program can be resumed and it's execution can continue.  

### **Exception handling :**  

*Syntax:*  

```python
try :
    x = int(input("Enter a number : "))
    y = 1/x
    print(y)

except ZeroDivisionError :
    print("You cannot divide by zero")

except ValueError :
    print("Please enter an integer")

except :
    print("Something else went wrong")

print("This gets executed.")
```

If the `try` block fails, the `except` block code is executed according to the error arised. 

The code below `except` block is executed if the error is handled by the `try-except` blocks of code.
