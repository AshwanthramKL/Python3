# **Generators :**  

Specialized code that's able to return a series of values, and control the iteration process.  

*Iterator :*  
A data type that implements the iterator protocol. eg. range()  
A value is an iterator if it provides two things.  

* \_\_iter\_\_() : Returns the object.

* \_\_next\_\_ : Returns the next value of the series of values.


User-defined generators are created using these 2 methods.  

___


**_yield_** :

Freezes the value until the next invocation.
eg.

```python
for i in range(7):
    yield i
```

O/P :
```python
0  
1  
2  
3  
4
5
6
```
