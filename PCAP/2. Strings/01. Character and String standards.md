# **Strings :**  

* Computers don't actually store strings as string values.  
They store characters as numbers.

* Each character corresponds to a unique number and vice-versa.

* Most commonly used character-number assignment is ASCII  (American Standard Code for Information Interchanged).

___

### **ASCII :**  

* It provides space for 256 characters.  

* Uses 8 bits for each sign.  

* Not flexible enough for internationalisation.  

* First 128 bits used for Upper and Lowercase characters.  

>Note :  
A code point is a unique number which makes a character.  
eg. 32 - space in ASCII

___


### **UNICODE :**  

* Assigns unique characters to more than a million code points.  

* First 128 code points are similar to ASCII.  

* Commonly used UNICODE is UTF-8(Unicode Transformation Format).

* UTF-8 uses as many bits for each code point as needed to represent them.  All lesson characters and standared ASCII characters occupy 8 bits.
