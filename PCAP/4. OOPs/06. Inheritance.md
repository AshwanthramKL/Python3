# **Inheritance**  

* Ability of a class to inherit data, properties from another class.

* `super()__init__()` is used to call the constructor of the Parent class.  

	eg.  

	```python
	class Person(object): #Parent or Base Class

		def __init__(self, name):
			self.name = name



	class Employee(Person): # Inherited or Derived Class

		def __init__(self, name,salary):
			
			super().__init__(self.name) #Calling the constructor of the Base class
			self.salary = salary



	emp = Person("Geek1") # An Object of Person
	emp = Employee("Geek2", 2332) # An Object of Employee
	```

* When an object of Derived class is created, it automatically invokes the constructor of the Base class if the Derived class doesn't have a constructor.

### **Types of inheritance :** 

There are four types of inheritance in python.  

1. Single Inheritance.

2. Multiple Inheritance.

3. Multilevel Inheritance.

4. Hierarchical Inheritance.

### **Method Overriding :**  

Python looks higher up in the inheritance chain when it cannot find a property associated with a class from which our object derives.  

Python looks Top to Bottom, Left to Right.

MRO(Method Resolution Order) works in a similar way too.
