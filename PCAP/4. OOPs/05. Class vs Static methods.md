# **Class vs Static Methods :**  

### **CSV files :**  

CSV - Comma Seperated Values.

In a CSV file, each line represents a single structured data.

### **Why CSV?**      
* In the given example, the actual data and the code are maintained in the same python file.  

* But for the ease of accesibility and debugging we must store it seperately.  
This is where we use a `CSV file` using the `.csv` extension as it allows data to be saved in a table structured format.  

    ```
    name,price,quantity
    "1+",29000,1
    "Samsung",27500,5
    "Realme",23000,2
    ```

### **Reading a CSV file using a *_Class method_* :**  

* We must import the `csv` library.

    ```python
    import csv
    ```


* To read a csv file we need to create a method inside our class,and to access that method we need an instance which is not available, therefore we  change the method to a `class method`.

*Syntax:*  

```python
class Class:
    @classmethod #Decorator 
    def Method_name(cls) #Class object is passed as the first argument
      with open("fileName.csv", "Mode") as alias_filename:
             reader = csv.DictReader(alias_filename)  #Used to convert the csv file into a list of dictionaries
            items = list(reader) 


Class.Method_name()
```
 

>Hint:  
Decorators in Python is a quick way to change the behaviour of the functions we create by basically calling them just before the line that we create our function.

### **Creating instances from data in CSV file :**  


*Syntax:*  

```python
import csv

class Class:
    @classmethod #Decorator 
    def Method_name(cls) #Class object is passed as the first argument
        with open("fileName.csv", "Mode") as alias_filename:
             reader = csv.DictReader(alias_filename)  #Used to convert the csv file into a list of dictionaries
            items = list(reader) 
        
        for item in items: #Iterating through the dictionary   
        #Creating an instance everytime the loop runs
            print(item)    #Visualizing the data
            Class(                 
                name = item.get('name'), 
                price = float(item.get('price')), #Remeber to type cast as python stores the contents of a csv file as strings.
                quantity = int(item.get('quantity'))
            )


Class.Method_name()
```


O/P :

```python
OrderedDict([('name', '1+'), ('price', '29000'), ('quantity', '1')])
OrderedDict([('name', 'Samsung'), ('price', '27500'), ('quantity', '5')])
OrderedDict([('name', 'Realme'), ('price', '23000'), ('quantity', '2')])

```

### **Static Methods :**


* A method that is bound to the class and not the object of the class.  

*  It is present in a class because it makes sense for the method to be present in class. It is more of a utility function inside the class rather than a method.

* It cannot access or modify the class behaviour.

* It can also be accessed from an instance.

*Syntax:*  

```python
class Class:
    @staticmethod #Decorator 
    def Method_name(argument) # Dont take instance as parameter by default
    
    # Checks if the floats are point zero
    if isinstance(num, float):  #inbuilt function
        return num.is_integer()
    elif isinstance(num, int):
        return True
    else:
        return False

print(Class.Method_name(8))
print(Class.Method_name(12.5))
print(Class.Method_name(69.0))
```
 
O/P :

```python
  True
  False
  True
```

### **Differences :**  

|Class method | Static method  |
|:----:|:-------: |
| Takes `cls` as first parameter     | No specific parameter          |
| Can access or modify class state     | Can't access or modify class state          |
|      |          |
