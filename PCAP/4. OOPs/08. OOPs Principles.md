# **OOPs Principles :**  

They are : 
* Encapsulation
* Abstraction 
* Polymorphism 
* Inheritance

___

1. **Encapsulation :**

    * Wrapping data and methods that work on data within one unit(class in our case).

    * It prevents accidental modification of data.

2. **Abstraction :**  

    * Hiding the non-essential details.

    * It is acheived through encapsulation.  

3. **Polymorphism :**  

    * Refers to the use of a single entity that knows how to handle different kinds of objects.

    * Functions differently according to the arguments passed.  

4. **Inheritance :**  

    * Ability of a class to inherit data, properties from another class.

    * It provides the re-usability of the code.
